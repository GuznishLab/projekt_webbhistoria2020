    <h1>Apache Roller</h1>
    <p>Apache Roller is a Java-based open-source "full-featured, Multi-blog, Multi-user, and group-blog server suitable for blog sites large and small". Roller was originally written by Dave Johnson in 2002 for a magazine article on open source development tools,[4] but became popular at FreeRoller.net (now JRoller.com) and was later chosen to drive the employee blogs at Sun Microsystems, Inc. and IBM developerWorks blogs.[2]

        On April 23, 2007, Roller project graduated from incubator, so it became an official project of the Apache Software Foundation and it was released 3.1 version, first official release.
